# 🐢 Turtle Race Game
A simple and fun Python game built using the turtle graphics module. Players can bet on which colored turtle they think will win the race — and then watch the race unfold in real time!

# 🎮 How It Works
When you run the program, a window opens showing six colorful turtles at the starting line.
A dialog box pops up asking you to place your bet — enter the color of the turtle you think will win (e.g., blue, yellow, etc.).
Once you confirm your choice, the race begins! Each turtle moves forward by a random distance each turn.
When a turtle crosses the finish line, a popup dialog announces the winner and tells you whether you won or lost your bet.
Click anywhere on the window to close it after the race ends.
